      <p id="Sentence-1" style="color:slateblue;"> I don't really know what I'm doing writing a website but hey here I am and if you're seeing this then I guess you are along for the ride.</p>
        <br />
         <p>I just got into coding but we will see where it takes us, I'm going to use this as a kind of "coding journal" if you will.</p>
        <br />
      <p>Maybe I could use it as a neat way to do the finances, in my own kinda way. Maybe I could find jobs building sites ya know.<br />
      Something I really wanna do is be able to build my own game but im just now learning how to do this, so not yet but someday.<br />you bet on it.</p>

              <th scope="col">Collum#1</th>
